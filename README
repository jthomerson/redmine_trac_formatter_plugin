= Redmine Trac Wiki Formatter

This is a redmine plugin that supports Trac-style wiki markup
within Redmine.  This makes it easier for those that would like
to "upgrade" from Trac to Redmine without losing an existing wiki
or those who are using Redmine but prefer Trac's wiki formatting
over that of Redmine's
